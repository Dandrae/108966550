<p> Welcome to my new webpage. Everything you want to know about me is in this web page.</p> 
<p> My name is Daniel Dzagah.I was born in 37 Military Hospital in Accra and I’m 22 years of age, I am the eldest and my brother is three years younger.</p>
<P> I grew up in Cantonments, later in adolescence I was an active member of my high school’s council. I did my higher secondary school education at Oti Boateng Senior High School.</p> 
<p> Well, I was a laborious and innocent student and got many awards in academics and co-curricular activities in my school. Information, Communication and Technology(ICT) was my favourite subject</P>
<p> I am currently in University of Ghana offering Information Technology(I.T) and I still feel fortunate whenever I get a chance to learn and explore it in different ways. My long term goal is to become a software engineer and earn respect and fame. 
<p> Well,I am still working on it and trying to become what I’ve always desired for.The reason why I want to pursue a degree in I.T is to someday be able to provide a subsidized technological services to a magnitude of people in Ghana and the world as a whole. 
<p> Hence, I study hard because without a degree I cannot attain these goals.
<p> Aside my love for everything tech related, I love to travel and meet new people. I am an outgoing person and I love to have fun. My live centers on improving humanity and I love where I am at right now. </p>
